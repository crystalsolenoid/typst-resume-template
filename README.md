# A Typst Resume Template

A [Typst](https://typst.app/) resume template for anyone who wants to use or modify it. I got started with Typst a couple of days ago and threw this together based on my old LaTeX resume.

## Usage

Define individual items in `items.typ`, add these items to the section lists in `sections.typ`, and customize the order of the sections in `main.typ`. If you open this in the [Typst web editor](https://typst.app/) and double-click on any of the text in the preview output, it will jump you to the point in the code to edit it.

I recommend making variables at the top of `items.typ` for things like schools and cities, if any of those repeat often in your resume data.

## Limitations

The positioning of the (optional) links in the projects section is a little weird. If your project titles are too long, you'll have to adjust the position manually. Suggestions welcome.

## Other Information

SVG's are from the free pack at [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/download). I only included the ones I used.
